# MLAlgorithmsFromScratch
Personal Project on developing ML algorithms in python without using any external library except numpy and pandas
Suitable metrics are used to compare said algorithms to precompiled libraries like SKLearn etc

Current Algorithms:-
  1. K Nearest Neigbour Classification (Gives accuracy better than SKLearn however runtime is much longer)
  2. Single/Multiple Linear Regression (on-par with Sklearn on accuracy, not in runtime)
  3. KMeans Clustering
